## Hi there 👋

I'm Cristine

- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming as part of my studies  
- 👯 I’d like to collaborate on small student projects to practice my skills, especially in coding  
- 🤔 I’m still figuring things out and looking for help to improve my coding skills  
- 📫 You can reach me through GitHub or my email account  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to debug codes because it feels satisfying when the code finally works  
- 🎒 Just an average student trying to learn step by step  
- 📖 Outside of coding, I spend time watching shows, biking, and playing some online games
